## 🎯 Features

- 🌍 City & month-based prediction
- 🔌 Input for number & hours of ACs, fans, fridges
- 📊 Bill visualization chart (auto-generated)
- 💡 Energy-saving recommendations
- 🌌 Stunning cosmic UI with smooth animations
- 🎯 Backend powered by a trained ML model

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KolekarPratiksha/Smart-Energy-Consumption-Prediction-using-AI-ML
````

### 2. Create a virtual environment

#### On Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Flask app

```bash
python app.py
```

### 5. Open in your browser

Go to: [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

## 🧠 How It Works

* Collects user input: device count, usage hours, city, and month.
* Uses a **trained machine learning model** to estimate monthly kWh usage.
* Looks up the local power company & tariff for accurate billing.
* Generates a **matplotlib** chart (`chart.png`) showing usage trend.
* Displays personalized energy-saving **recommendations**.
* Offers a rich, ambient front-end experience.
